----------------------
To build an AR-based interior design app that uses AI-powered object detection for identifying and gathering dimensions of objects like doors, windows, and AC units in real-time scans, we will need to integrate AI models like YOLO or MobileNet with Unity, specifically using Unity Sentis, which supports running machine learning models directly within Unity. Below is an outline for how you might go about implementing such a system, including the Python code and Unity setup.
1. Understanding the Requirements

The objective is to:

    Integrate AI models (YOLO, MobileNet) for object detection in Augmented Reality (AR) using Unity Sentis.
    Identify objects in real-time room scans and extract dimensions.
    Ensure smooth performance on Android and iOS devices.

2. Step-by-Step Breakdown
Step 1: Preparing the AI Models

You need to train or use pre-trained object detection models like YOLO or MobileNet. The models will be used to detect objects (doors, windows, AC units) in real-time camera feeds. To deploy the models in Unity, we need to convert them to the ONNX format (Open Neural Network Exchange).

    Training the models: You can train a model using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and then export the trained model to ONNX format.

    Here's an example of converting a PyTorch YOLO model to ONNX:

    import torch
    import torchvision

    # Load pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO)
    model = torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
    model.eval()

    # Example dummy input
    dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Adjust for input size

    # Convert to ONNX
    torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "yolo_model.onnx")

Step 2: Setting Up Unity for AR

    Install Unity and Unity AR Foundation:
        Install Unity Hub and Unity with AR Foundation support for both Android and iOS platforms.
        Use Unity’s AR Foundation to manage cross-platform AR development.
    Add Unity Sentis:
        Unity Sentis is a package to deploy machine learning models (including ONNX) within Unity. Make sure that Unity Sentis is installed from the Unity Package Manager.

Step 3: Importing and Running the AI Model in Unity

Once you have the ONNX model, you can import it into Unity Sentis. The following steps guide you through this process:

    Create a new Unity project.
    Import AR Foundation (to manage AR features).
    Import Unity Sentis (for running the model).

Now, to run the model inside Unity, you can use the following Unity C# script:

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;
using UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems;
using Unity.Sentis;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class ObjectDetectionAR : MonoBehaviour
{
    private ARSessionOrigin arSessionOrigin;
    private ARCameraManager arCameraManager;
    private ARRaycastManager arRaycastManager;
    private Model model;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        arSessionOrigin = GetComponent<ARSessionOrigin>();
        arCameraManager = arSessionOrigin.GetComponent<ARCameraManager>();
        arRaycastManager = arSessionOrigin.GetComponent<ARRaycastManager>();

        // Load the ONNX model
        model = Model.Load("yolo_model.onnx");  // Load YOLO model (adjust path)
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        // Get the latest camera frame
        ARCameraBackground cameraBackground = arCameraManager.GetComponent<ARCameraBackground>();

        // Pass the camera frame to the AI model for object detection
        var frameData = cameraBackground.texture;
        var objectsDetected = model.DetectObjects(frameData);  // Detect objects using model

        // Process the detected objects
        foreach (var detectedObject in objectsDetected)
        {
            Vector3 position = detectedObject.Position;
            string label = detectedObject.Label;

            // Implement AR visualization (e.g., highlight detected objects in AR)
            HighlightDetectedObject(position, label);
        }
    }

    // Function to highlight detected objects
    void HighlightDetectedObject(Vector3 position, string label)
    {
        // Code to create visual markers in AR space
        // Example: Instantiate AR object or display labels
    }
}

    Explanation:
        This script handles AR-based object detection using Unity’s AR Foundation.
        The DetectObjects method processes the camera frame using the ONNX model (YOLO or MobileNet).
        Detected objects are then highlighted in the AR environment.

Step 4: Object Dimension Gathering

For dimension gathering, you'll need to calculate distances between detected objects and the camera.

// Function to calculate object dimensions
float CalculateObjectDimensions(Vector3 objectPosition, Camera camera)
{
    // Use the AR environment to compute distance and dimensions
    float distance = Vector3.Distance(objectPosition, camera.transform.position);
    // Return the object's dimensions (e.g., using bounding box or predefined object scale)
    return distance;
}

You can integrate this with the object detection function to gather the dimensions of detected objects, such as doors or windows.
Step 5: Mobile Optimization

To ensure smooth performance on mobile devices (iOS and Android):

    Optimize the AI Model: Use techniques like quantization or pruning to reduce the size and complexity of the model without sacrificing accuracy.
    Manage AR Rendering: Ensure efficient rendering of AR objects. Optimize texture sizes, reduce the frequency of frame updates for AR camera capture, and optimize object rendering complexity.
    Test on Devices: Use Unity’s mobile build system to test the app on Android and iOS devices and make necessary adjustments.

Step 6: Testing and Validation

    Test Object Detection Accuracy: Validate the object detection model under different lighting conditions and room layouts.
    Measure Performance: Monitor the performance on both Android and iOS devices, ensuring low latency and smooth interactions.

Key Deliverables for the MVP:

    AI-powered AR object detection for identifying doors, windows, and AC units in real-time.
    Dimension gathering of detected objects.
    Mobile-optimized Unity app for Android and iOS.
    Seamless integration with Unity Sentis for running AI models.
    Testing for accuracy across varying conditions.

Conclusion:

By using Unity’s AR Foundation, Unity Sentis for machine learning, and deploying models like YOLO or MobileNet in ONNX format, you can create an advanced AR interior design app with real-time object detection and dimension gathering. Make sure to focus on mobile optimization and performance testing to ensure a seamless user experience.

This app will significantly enhance the user experience for interior designers or users looking to design and visualize rooms, offering an intuitive, AI-powered tool for object recognition and dimensioning in an AR environment.
